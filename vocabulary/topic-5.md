# Topic 5: Culture, art and traditions

## About topic 5

The Culture, art and traditions topic includes human folklore, ceremonies and rituals, myths and legends, social customs, traditional languages, dress and arts, the impact of modenr life on traditional lifestyles and differences in national habits.

Please remember that IELTS will not ask specifically about religion, politics or spiritual beliefs, and you should not base your answers in the Writing of Speaking tests on your personal beliefs in these areas. For example, if the task asks whether you argee with a certain idea, you would get a low mark if you say _'Yes, because my religion agrees with it/because my President has this policy'_ or similar.

You can certainly use religious or political situations as evidence or examples to suport an argument, but not as a starting point. For example, *'We should give money to charity because it benefits society, as ew can see for example in coutries where religious observance requires people to do this regularly.'* This is a more logical and academic way to respond.

## Topic 5 example task
In many countries, traditional dess and costumes are considered effective ways of maintaining links with the past. How effective can traditional costumes be, in this sense? What other ways exist to help citizens connect with a country's past?

## Explanation of the Task
This is an Ideas/Evaluate type essay.

It does not ask for your opinion about whether costumes are good or bad, but it asks for you to decide wheter these costumes are effective (or not effective) ways of maintaining links with the past, and to suggest other ways of connecting to the past. You should say how effective costimes are, with examples and evidence, and then compare their effectiveness to some other possible ways of connecting to the past.

Remember that, 'Ideas/Evaluate' means that you should compare things in the way that they are used in society, but not decide on your personal perference about these things.

## Band 9 model essay
Most people would agree that **preserving** connections with our past is an admirable object, especially as the world evolves so rapidly. I feel that traditional costumes are one part of doing this, but they are by no means the most important, as we shall see.

Admittedly, historic dress plays a key role in social events such as religious **rituals** or military **parades**, and these events are helpful in **transmitting social memes** such as **public duty** and **self-sacrifice**. Traditional costumes also remind us of the origins of **cultural traditions and mythologies**, for instance the historic Swiss national dress which **evokes** their **medieval** independence.

However, it must be said that costumes are an accessory in these situations, and do not appear to constitute the central message. It is the **ceremonies** themselves which convey the **cultural norms** that help to maintain **the fabric of society**. In this sense, the costumes are of secondary importance. Furthermore, it seems that there are in fact much more powerfull ways in which culture is **conserved** and **handed down** between the generations. Most countries have a richs **heritage** of **legends** and **folklore** about the birth and development of their nation, some of which are mythological and some being grounded in truth (as we see in the English stories about Robin Hood or George and the Dragon, for example). These stories are a **cultural inheritance** which embodies important symbols and concepts far more effectively than dress. Similarly, we must remember the significance of art and music in passing on our traditions, in **forms** ranging from **fine art** to **handicrafts**, and from **opera** to traditional **shanties** and **dirges**. The presence of visual or **linguistic** messages in these **media** make them more effective than costumes, which convey no language.

Overall, we must recognise and welcome the use of traditional dress in helping to maintain our cultures. However, the forms of story, art and music would appear to be the driving forces in this invaluable process.
