# 1. Spending time with others
**- Do you like talking with people?**

Well, It depends on what I'm doing at that moment. If I have to do my work, you know, my homework or tasks in my office, I want to focus totally on my own. But, in my free time, I quite like chatting with my co-workers or my friends. **I particularly appreciate discussing various topics that interest me, such as technology, how we work efficiently, or some kind of drama in work.**

**- How do you like spending time with your friends?**

You know, life nowadays is hustle and bustle. I have to work in the office from Monday to Friday and study master's in the evening. Therefore, I don't have much time for my friends on weekdays. Sometimes, when my work is done and I am free on weekends, I usually go out and have some coffee with them or we can go for a soccer match. **This is a great way we unwind and strengthen our bond**.

**- Would you prefer to study alone or with others?**

I think it depends on what I learn. In the case I do my homework or personal research, I prefer to study alone because it allows me to concentrate better and work at my own pace. **I find that when I'm by myself, I can focus more deeply on the material without distractions.** But If I have to cooperate or learn something that I don't know much about, I prefer to exchange knowledge with others. Because, in this way, I can learn faster and avoid mistakes that they made.

**- Do you remember a time when you need to cooperate with others?**

When I was in university, we had to do a pet project, some kind of sound classification by AI. My group had 3 people, including me. I worked really hard on this project the others were not focusing on it. Therefore, I have to do the project alone. Because this is a team project, my teacher grades the cooperation of each other. They didn't care about the work but had the same grade as me. This really pissed me off at that time. But after that, because of doing it on my own, I learned so much about the topic and I think it's not that bad at all.

# 2. Pets & Animals
**- What's your favourite animal?**

You know, my best-loved animal is a dog. I love dogs because they are loyal, and friendly, and always seem to bring happiness to those around them. They have a special way of connecting with people, and I enjoy spending time with them, whether it's playing, going for a walk, or simply relaxing together. Unlike humans, dogs respond with all their love and affection and most importantly they would never harm us with malicious intentions.

**- What is the most popular animal in your country?**

I think, out of all the animal species in my country dogs are probably the most famous. I see many households have dogs as pets because they are considered loyal and protective companions. They are often seen as part of the family and are valued for their ability to provide both security and emotional support.

**- Have you ever had a pet before?**

I did have a pet when I was a child. He was a nice dog, and my family named him "VÃ ng" since he has golden fur. We together made great companions and showered unconditional love, come rain or shine. Unfortunately, he died several years ago, and I miss him so much.

**- Where do you perfer to keep your pet, indoors or outdoors?**

I think it depends on where I live. If I live in an apartment, in urban, I will keep them indoors because there's no space for them. I will take them for a walk in the afternoon. But, if I have a house with a yard and a garden, then I will leave them outside. Such as dogs, since they are so energetic, need space to run, and play, and keeping them inside may stress them.

# 3. Shoes
**- Do you like buying shoes? How often?**

Definitely, Buying shoes is my cup of tea, especially soccer boots because I always spend my weekends with my friends playing soccer. In the past, I used to buy a new pair of soccer boots when there was a new model. But now, I think it's not necessary. Saving money is more important now.

**- Have you ever bought shoes online?**

To be honest, I have never bought shoes online. I know buying shoes online have its convinient. But every branch have their sizes, so I have to go for a try in the store to make sure they fit me.

**- How much money do you usually spend on shoes?**

Well, on average, I spend somewhere around 150$ on my footwear. Actually, I often look for some doorbuster deals and never miss any Black Friday ever.

**- Which do you prefer, fashionable shoes or comfortable shoes?**

I believe most people would agree that comfortable shoes are often preferred over stylish shoes. Fashionable shoes undoubtedly look eye-grabbing from a distance, but as it's said the devil is in the details; they mostly lack cushioning and comfort. On the other hand, comfortable shoes are affordable with a great fit.
